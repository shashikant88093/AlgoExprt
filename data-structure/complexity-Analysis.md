> Complexity Analysis

  The process of determine how efficient an algorithm is . Complexity analysis usually involves finding both the **time complexity** and the space **Space Complexity** of an algorithm.

  Complexity analysis is effectively used to determine how good and algorithm is and whether it's "better" than another one.


> Time Complexity 

  A measure of how fast an algorithm runs, time complexity is a central concept in the field of algorithm and in coding interviews.

  it's expressed using **Big O** notation

> Space Complexity

  A measure of how much auxiliary memory an algorithm takes up, space complexity is a concept in the field of algorithm and in coding interviews.

  it's expressed using **Big O** notation
